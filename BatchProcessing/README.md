# Batch Processing

These scripts ONLY work with version 1.1.6 of the MicrosoftTeams module. This can be found [here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/1.1.6).

You will have to import this module explicitly if you have a newer version of the module installed prior to running the scripts in this repository.
~~~
Import-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams -RequiredVersion 1.1.6
~~~
If you have already run other cmdlets found in the MicrosoftTeams module, you will need to open a new PowerShell session/window prior to running the above cmdlet.
